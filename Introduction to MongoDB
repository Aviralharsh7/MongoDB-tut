1. What can we do with MongoDB atlas? 
- acts as a platform where you store data.
- embed search functionality into our database.
- host a full application. 
- send queries across multiple clusters and transform or move data across them.

2. MongoDB Atlas Clusters 
- Cluster is a group of servers that are connected via a network. 
- Cluster holds mutiple copies of our data. 
- Servers are allocated based on geographic location, load balancing, traffic patterns, and user proximity. 

3. Deploying at Atlas Cluster
- After adding sample data, the data size is 0.0B

4. MongoDB database
- MongoDB is based on document model. 
- Document model is more flexible compared to Table model. 
- MongoDB can have data of various types like, Time series, graph data, real-time analytics, etc. 

- Document is basic unit of Data here. 
- Grouping of documents is called collections.
- One or more collections form a database.
// org > project > cluster

- MongoDB database is the foundation of Atlas, which in turn evolves into a platform, offering additional functionalities (search, data visualization, mobile device sync, etc) 
// the additional functionalities are built on top of data stored in cloud-hosted MongoDB databases. 

5. MongoDB Document Model 
- MongoDB displays in JSON but stores in BSON.
- BSON supports a superset of datatypes supported by JSON and more (dates,numbers, objectId). 
- Example of few datatypes - 32bit integer, 64 bit integer, double, decimal128, object, array, objectId.

- ObjectId auto-generates a unique identifier for a "document" if it is missing _id field. 
- _id field is unique and compulsary for every document in MongoDB.

- Flexible schema model means that document in a same collection are not required to share a common structure of fields and value types by default. (polymorphic documents)
